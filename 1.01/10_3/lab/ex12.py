# Exercise 1.2. Write Python code to evaluate these expressions.
# The answers can be stored in a name, or evaluated in a print statement

# 1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?

print(42*60 + 42)
answr = 42 * 60 + 42
print(answr)

#there are 2562 secons in 42 minutes and 42 seconds


# 2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61
# kilometers in a mile.

mile = 0.621371
print(mile * 10)

#there are 6.2 miles in 10 kilometers


# 3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?


miles = 6.21
pace = 2562/miles
print (pace/60)

#your average speed would 6.9 mph
